# Project rundown

This is a personal React web-app project with filter, search, and multiple view options functionalities in a library of books, shows, and films that I've seen. I created a custom [JSON API](https://my-media-api-project.herokuapp.com/media) containing all the media, with the code [here](https://github.com/luluzhu9/media-api). 

# React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
